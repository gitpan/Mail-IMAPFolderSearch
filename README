Mail::IMAPFolderSearch - Search multiple mail folders via a IMAP4rev1 server

REQUIRES
    IO::Socket, IO::Socket::SSL

DESCRIPTION
    Many e-mail clients such as PINE allow the user to search for a string
    within a single folder. Mail::IMAPFolderSearch allows for scripting of
    multiple string searches, spanning multiple mail folders. Results are
    placed in a new folder allowing the user to use their existing mail
    client to view matching messages. The results folder is named IMAPSearch
    by default, but it is possible to specify a different name.
